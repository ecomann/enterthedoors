    <p>The Doors were not only considered to be very exceptional at their instruments and poetical songwriting but their ability to make their instruments work together to invoke a story or an emotion were also unlike many others, Jim's mysterious tone and cryptic storylike lyricism, Ray's equally skilled and cryptic playing on the keyboards, Robby's versatile, memorable and distinct playing and finally John's groovy but smooth jazz rock drumming that just glues their blues sounds together as if they were destined to be in a band together.</p>
