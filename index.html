	<h3>About <b>The Doors</b></h3>

	<p><b>The Doors</b> were an American blues rock formed in 
	    1965 with 4 members <em>(see later)</em>. There were considered 
		to be one of the most influential but controversial 
		rock bands to happen in the 1960s, mostly due to the 
		band's frontman's poetic lyricism and iconic voice 
		with his erratic stage persona.</p>

	<p>The band took its name from a book named <em>"The Doors of 
		Perception"</em>, which itself is a reference to a quote 
		by the English poet <strong>William Blake.</strong></p>

    <p><b>The Doors</b> had a unique ability to combine poetic storytelling in their lyrics with uplifting, bouncy and energising blues rock, which both defined their sound from their very first but very successful self-titled album <em>"The Doors"</em> which was (and still is) widely considered to be one of the best rock albums of the 1960s, all the way to their last released album to date, <em>"An American Prayer"</em>.</p>
